# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-in-Food-Waste-Prediction
A Comprehensive Analysis of Global Food Wastage (SDG 12)
This project presents an in-depth data-driven exploration of global food wastage patterns, supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. Using a rich dataset covering 214 countries, we analyze food waste across households, retail, and food service sectors to uncover regional disparities, inefficiencies, and actionable strategies for waste reduction.

# What’s Inside?
#Data Handling & EDA:
Cleaned and explored a comprehensive food wastage dataset with detailed visualizations (bar plots, box plots, heatmaps, and more) to reveal key trends and regional differences.

# Predictive Modeling:
Built advanced multi-output regression models using XGBoost to predict future food waste (2025–2030) in different sectors, evaluated with R² and MSE metrics.

# Explainable AI:
Leveraged SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret model predictions, generate summary and force plots, and highlight the most impactful features driving food waste.

# Actionable Insights:
Provided clear, data-backed recommendations for policymakers and stakeholders to support sustainable consumption and production practices globally.
